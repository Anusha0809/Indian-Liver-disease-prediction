<h1>LIVER DISEASE PREDICTION</h1></center>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><h3>Using ML, we can predict the liver disease in advance by applying different machine learning algorithms. Liver is the largest internal organ in the human body, it is essential for           digesting food and releasing the toxic element of the body and plays a major role in metabolism and serving several vital functions</h3>
<h3>          The following baseline characteristics were significant predictors of liver disease diagnosis: increasing GGT, decreasing albumin, alcohol dependency, being female, increasing ALP, living in a deprived area and younger age</h3>
<h3>          The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances. Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity</h3>
<h3>The liver plays an important role in many bodily functions from protein production and blood 
clotting to cholesterol, glucose (sugar), and iron metabolism. It has a range of functions, including 
removing toxins from the body, and is crucial to survival.</h3> <h3> The loss of those functions can cause 
significant damage to the body. When liver is infected with a virus, injured by chemicals, or 
under attack from own immune system, the basic danger is the same – that liver will become so 
damaged that it can no longer work to keep a person alive.</h3><h3> Liver disease caused by hepatotrophic 
viruses imposes a substantial burden on health care resources. Persistent infections from hepatitis 
B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis delta virus result in chronic liver disease. The 
most basic classification of liver disease is as acute and chronic.</h3><h3> The definition of acute liver 
disease is based on duration, with the history of the disease does not exceed six months. Acute 
viral hepatitis and drug reactions account for the majority of cases of acute liver disease. 
Liver disease is also referred to as hepatic disease. Usually nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, fatigue and weakness are classic symptoms of liver disease. Symptoms of liver 
patient include jaundice, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, back pain, abdominal 
swelling, weight loss, fluid in abnormal cavity, general itching, pale stool, enlarged spleen and 
gallbladder [1]. Symptoms of liver disease can vary, but they often include swelling of the 
abdomen and legs, bruising easily, changes in the colour of your stool and urine, and jaundice, or 
yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests 
and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.</h3></p>
